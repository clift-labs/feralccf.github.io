<h1>Feral Code Composition Framework</h1>
<h2>What is Feral</h2>
<p>
    Feral is an open source framework that allows a software engineer to write small amounts of code and include it
    into a process. Most software
</p>
<h2>What is a code composition framework (CCF)?</h2>
<p>
    Using a code composition framework written in PHP is like building with Legos. Just like with Legos, the
    framework provides building blocks that can be easily assembled to create a wide range of structures. These
    building blocks are in the form of pre-built code components that perform specific functions, such as database
    handling, user authentication, and templating. Developers can select the components they need, and assemble them
    together in a logical way to create a complete application. This makes the development process quicker and more
    efficient, as developers don't need to start from scratch each time they build an application. Additionally, just
    like with Legos, the framework components can be easily swapped out or upgraded, making it easy to modify an
    application over time. Overall, building with a code composition framework written in PHP is a fun and efficient
    way to create complex web applications, just like building with Legos.

<h2>Why is Feral Open Source?</h2>
<p>
    Open source software offers a wide range of benefits, both for individuals and businesses. First and foremost,
    open source software is free to use, modify, and distribute, which makes it an excellent choice for those who are
    looking for a cost-effective solution. Additionally, open source software is typically more secure than proprietary
    software, as it is developed and maintained by a large community of developers who are constantly working to
    identify and fix vulnerabilities. This community-driven approach also means that open source software is often
    more innovative and adaptable, as developers are free to experiment and contribute new ideas. Furthermore, open
    source software offers greater flexibility and customization, as users are able to modify the code to suit their
    specific needs. Finally, open source software encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing, which can lead to
    faster development and a more vibrant and supportive community. Overall, open source software offers a range of
    benefits that make it an attractive choice for businesses and individuals alike.

<h2>Why is Feral written in PHP?</h2>
<p>
    PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular server-side scripting language used to develop web applications. Here
    are some of the benefits of using PHP:
<ul>
    <li>
        Easy to learn: PHP is relatively easy to learn, especially for those with a background in programming. Its
        syntax is similar to C and Java, making it easy to understand and write code.
    </li>
    <li>
    Open-source: PHP is an open-source language, which means it is free to use, distribute, and modify. This makes
        it a cost-effective choice for businesses of all sizes.
    </li>
    <li>
    Platform independent: PHP can run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. This makes
        it a versatile language that can be used on a wide range of platforms.
    </li>
    <li>
    Large community: PHP has a large and active community of developers, who contribute to its development and maintenance. This means that there is a wealth of knowledge and resources available to developers who use PHP.
    </li>
    <li>
    High performance: PHP is a high-performance language, which means it can handle a large number of requests simultaneously without slowing down. It is also designed to integrate with other technologies, such as databases and web servers, which can further improve its performance.
    </li>
</ul>
    Overall, the benefits of using PHP include ease of use, cost-effectiveness, versatility, community support, and high performance, making it a popular choice for developing web applications.
