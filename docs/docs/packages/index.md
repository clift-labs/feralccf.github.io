## Packages are how we distribute Feral

We use **Composer** to distribute Feral. Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP, similar to npm for JavaScript 
or pip for Python. It simplifies the process of managing PHP package dependencies required 
in a project. It was created to help PHP developers manage their projects efficiently by automatically 
handling package installations and updates. 

### Packages
* [Feral Core](./feral-core.md) - The base functionality of Feral
* [Feral Inline](./feral-inline.md) - A Symfony aware package to add code composition
